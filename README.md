ALFRED STREET BAPTIST CHURCH - DG 30 NEWSLETTERS
****************************************************
- This template was created from scratch in Canva using prior newsletters as a guide.
- Did a Google search for popular Bible verses so that we'd have a new one every month.
- Look in the dg30news@gmail.com email account for new annoucements to be shared.  This email will come from Geri Tucker.
- Lisa Tabor gives the final editing of what the layout should be.
- Geri sends an unedited email with the birthdays to be included.  That list is copied and pasted into a Google spreadsheet file.
  The column is selected, and then I navigate to: Data -> Split Text To Columns -> Seperator (choose space).  Then the list
  is ordered by the last name.  Those names are then transferred to the Canva textboxes in the newsletter.
- Pictures are added to the 'Uploads' section in Canva from the dg30new@gmail.com account.
- Update the volume #, Issue # and date as needed.
- Picture frames, names, locations and the write ups are added to the new member section first.  Pictures are then drag-and-dropped
  from 'Uploads' into the pre-sized picture frames.  This automatically resizes the photos.
- The next section can be used to announce anniversaries, to show pics from group outings, or any other group announcements.
- Below that is the bereavement section that lists members of the group that we should pray for in the loss of a loved one.
- Next, is the listing for the DG 30 team.  That list will include:
             - The Deacon Leader (Geri Tucker)
             - The President
             - The Secretary
             - The Deacon In Training
- At the very bottom of the 2nd page will be the group email address for members to submit inquires & updates.
